# VTOP-Bot
Automates Course Page Of VTOP (using Selenium) by opening course page of each subject on a new tab. (Check out the video in this repository to witness this in action.)

Well, students of Vellore Institute of Technology definitely know the pain in using VTOP's course page

To remember all the slots and to follow the really loooong process to access files can now come to an end with this VTOP Course Page Automator

Well, for this to work we need the following :-

  * Selenium module installed on PC
  * A web-driver of your choice (preferrably Chrome)
  * An extension file availbe in Repository (for Captcha purposes)
  * Data of your Course IDs and Class IDs

**Note:- The python file, extension file and the web-driver must all conatin in the same folder (or change the path to the file location in the code)**  

Make changes where required (which will be mentioned in the code using comments, so look out for them)

Kudos !! You are all set to use Course Page Automator which will help you get out of the endless loop of you opening Course Page every single day.
